Claims to the Parrot Wings implementation on base server (http://193.124.114.46:3001)

1) Users and transactions are identified with ascending integer numbers - it causes problems in distributed systems. It's better to use some GUIDs.

2) Each call to POST api/protected/transactions causes creation of 2 transactions (each one for sender and recipient) - it's excessive and makes development harder (atomicity of creation needs to be supported)

3) POST api/protected/transactions allows user to make transfer to himself - that has no sense.

4) In POST api/protected/transactions the receiver is identified with his name (which may be not unique). It's better to use id instead of it.

5)
Presently we have following server endpoints:
    POST /users - create/register a user
    POST /sessions/create - login
    GET /api/protected/transactions - list of logged user transactions
    POST /api/protected/transactions - create a transaction
    GET /api/protected/user-info - logged user info
    POST /api/protected/users/list - filtered User list

Taking into account this recommendation
(https://habr.com/ru/post/351890/),
it would be better to convert names of some of them:
    POST /users - create/register a user
    * POST /sessions - login
    GET /api/protected/transactions - list of logged user transactions
    POST /api/protected/transactions - create a transaction
    * GET /api/protected/users/{:userId} - logged user info
    * POST /api/protected/users - filtered User list
